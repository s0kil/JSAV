# JSAV (JavaScript Algorithm Visualization Library)

JSAV is a part of the [OpenDSA](https://github.com/OpenDSA/OpenDSA/) project.
OpenDSA aims to create a complete hyper-textbook for Data Structures and Algorithms along with the necessary supporting infrastructure.

## Documentation

The JSAV documentation is available at [jsav.io](http://jsav.io/)

## Extensions

for it or use data structures created by someone else. OpenDSA contains
several extensions which can be found
